This is a project to eventually create a map of EVE online and display it to a webpage using JS and Python.

Currently the only part that's functional is the ESI ripper.

Next step is to go region by region (or even constellation by constellation) and create a network using starget connections.
Then, try and display a constellation with some sort of automatic layout to make the connections human-readable. Next, region etc.

The eventual end-goal is to be able to add scouting information to each system with notes on what was scouted, which celestial it was at etc, and when the report was submitted - with a option to filter by report age, to give an easily read indicator of which information is out of date.
